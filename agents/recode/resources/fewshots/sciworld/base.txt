The current function to expand is:
solve(instruction, observation)
The variables you can use is:
- instruction (str): Your task is to use chemistry to create green paint. When you are done, focus on the green paint.
- observation (str): This room is called the bedroom. In it, you see:
the agent
a substance called air
a bed. On the bed is: a mattress. On the mattress is: a white pillow.
a closet. The closet door is open. In the closet is: nothing.
a picture
a table. On the table is: nothing.
You also see:
A door to the hallway (that is open)

[Output]
<think>
I need to find materials to create green paint, which are likely to be found in an art studio. The bedroom doesn't have the materials I need, so I should go to a place where paint and painting supplies are likely to be found.

- obs (str): This room is called the art studio. In it, you see:
the agent
a substance called air
a large cupboard. The large cupboard door is open. In the large cupboard is: a drawer, a wood cup (containing yellow paint), a wood cup (containing blue paint), a wood cup (containing red paint).
a table. On the table is: a glass cup (containing nothing).
a wood cup (containing yellow paint)
a wood cup (containing blue paint)
a wood cup (containing red paint)
You also see:
A door to the hallway (that is open)

[Output]
<think>
Now that I'm in the art studio, I can see blue paint and yellow paint which are the primary colors needed to mix green paint. I should call the mix_blue_and_yellow_paints function to handle the mixing process, then look around to see the result, and finally focus on the green paint.

<execute>
mix_blue_and_yellow_paints(obs)
obs = run("look around")

I can see blue paint and yellow paint available. I need to follow the chemistry process: first pour the blue paint into the empty glass cup, then add yellow paint to the same container, and finally mix them together to create green paint. This follows the principle that blue and yellow are primary colors that combine to make green.

Perfect! I can see that the glass cup now contains green paint. The task is to create green paint and then focus on it. Now that the green paint is made, I should concentrate on the final product.
