solve(instruction, observation)
The variables you can use is:
- instruction (str): Your task is to: put a cool mug in shelf.
- observation (str): You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a cabinet 9, a cabinet 8, a cabinet 7, a cabinet 6, a cabinet 5, a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a coffeemachine 1, a countertop 3, a countertop 2, a countertop 1, a drawer 9, a drawer 8, a drawer 7, a drawer 6, a drawer 5, a drawer 4, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a fridge 1, a garbagecan 1, a microwave 1, a shelf 3, a shelf 2, a shelf 1, a sinkbasin 1, a stoveburner 4, a stoveburner 3, a stoveburner 2, a stoveburner 1, and a toaster 1.

<think>
The task requires cooling, which must be done with the only fridge present (`fridge 1`). The final target is a shelf, and there are three shelves; I will choose `shelf 1` as an explicit target (the instruction’s phrasing implies a shelf; if a specific shelf is required, the upstream node should set it). I persist both IDs. I also create `all_location_IDs` from the initial observation. The plan decomposes into (1) find and take a mug by iterating known locations, handling closed receptacles via `open` and re-`examine`; (2) cool the mug at the fridge after ensuring access (navigate and open if closed); (3) place the mug on the chosen shelf (surfaces don’t need opening). Pitfalls: using the sink/microwave by mistake, assuming an object ID instead of extracting it, forgetting to re-`examine` after opening, or trying to place into a closed target.

solve(instruction, observation)
The variables you can use is:
- instruction (str): Your task is to: cool some pan and put it in stoveburner.
- observation (str): You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a cabinet 16, a cabinet 15, a cabinet 14, a cabinet 13, a cabinet 12, a cabinet 11, a cabinet 10, a cabinet 9, a cabinet 8, a cabinet 7, a cabinet 6, a cabinet 5, a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a coffeemachine 1, a countertop 2, a countertop 1, a diningtable 1, a drawer 5, a drawer 4, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a fridge 1, a garbagecan 1, a microwave 1, a safe 1, a sinkbasin 1, a stoveburner 4, a stoveburner 3, a stoveburner 2, a stoveburner 1, and a toaster 1.

[Output]
<think>
Cooling requires the fridge (`fridge 1`). The final placement is a specific burner; I set `stoveburner 1` as the target for determinism (if the upstream plan wants another burner, it should pass it). I will assemble `all_location_IDs`. The plan mirrors the previous case: search-and-take a pan with ID extraction; cool it at the fridge after ensuring access; navigate to the target burner (a surface) and place it. Watch for a closed fridge and for the temptation to use the microwave.

The goal is to navigate the room methodically to find any instance of the target object and pick it up. I will iterate through the known locations, always navigating first. If a location produces no new information, I will examine it. When a location is closed, I will open it before searching. Once I observe a concrete `{obj} k` mention, I will parse that exact ID and take it from the current location. Common pitfalls include not examining after navigation (missing items), failing to open a closed container, or taking without the full `obj_ID`.

for location_ID in all_location_IDs:
    obs = run(f'go to {location_ID}')

    location_closed = 'closed' in obs
    if location_closed:
        obs = run(f'open {location_ID}')
    if f" {obj} " in obs: # Prevent names from containing relationships
        obj_ID = re.search(rf'\b{obj} \d+\b', obs).group()

[Output]
<think>
Cooling is only valid with a fridge. I will ensure access to the fridge: navigate, examine, and open if closed, because some interactions may require an openable container state. Then I will issue the cooling command with the exact object ID. Pitfalls: using the wrong station (sink/microwave) or skipping the open step when it is needed.

The current function to expand is:
put_in(obj_ID, target_location_ID)
The variables you can use is:
- obj_ID (str): apple 1
- target_location_ID (str): sidetable 1

[Output]
<think>
I will navigate to the target location, examine if nothing happens, determine if it is closed, and open if needed. Then I will move the object in. This logic supports both containers (openable) and surfaces (non-openable, but harmless to check). Pitfalls: using the wrong ID in `examine` or skipping the `location_closed` check.

obs = run(f'go to {target_location_ID}')

    obs = run(f'open {target_location_ID}')
