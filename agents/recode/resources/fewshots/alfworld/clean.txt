[Input]
The current function to expand is:
solve(instruction, observation)
The variables you can use is:
- instruction (str): Your task is to: clean some apple and put it in sidetable.
- observation (str): You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a coffeemachine 1, a countertop 1, a diningtable 3, a diningtable 2, a diningtable 1, a drawer 1, a fridge 1, a garbagecan 1, a microwave 1, a sidetable 1, a sinkbasin 1, a stoveburner 4, a stoveburner 3, a stoveburner 2, a stoveburner 1, and a toaster 1.

[Output]
<think>
I first characterize the task: the object is an apple that must be cleaned (so the cleaning station is the only sinkbasin present) and finally placed on the sidetable. The initial observation provides a single `sinkbasin 1` and `sidetable 1`, so I persist both IDs. I also parse and persist all location IDs for later search. The expansion should be decomposed into three concrete phases: (1) acquire an apple by searching openable and non-openable receptacles; handle closures by opening when needed; once found, take the apple by its exact ID; (2) clean it strictly at the sinkbasin; (3) place it on the target surface, ensuring it is reachable (surfaces are non-openable, so navigation suffices). Typical mistakes to avoid include assuming an object ID without extracting it from observations, forgetting to open a closed container before taking, or trying to clean anywhere other than the sinkbasin.

<execute>
cleaning_location_ID = 'sinkbasin 1'
target_location_ID = 'sidetable 1'
obj = 'apple'
all_location_IDs = re.findall(r'[a-z]+(?:[a-z]+)? \d+', observation)

obj_ID = find_and_take(obj, all_location_IDs)
clean_with(obj_ID, cleaning_location_ID)
put_in(obj_ID, target_location_ID)
</execute>

The current function to expand is:
solve(instruction, observation)
The variables you can use is:
- instruction (str): Your task is to: put a clean lettuce in diningtable.
- observation (str): You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a cabinet 13, a cabinet 12, a cabinet 11, a cabinet 10, a cabinet 9, a cabinet 8, a cabinet 7, a cabinet 6, a cabinet 5, a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a coffeemachine 1, a countertop 1, a diningtable 1, a drawer 1, a fridge 1, a garbagecan 1, a microwave 1, a shelf 3, a shelf 2, a shelf 1, a sinkbasin 1, a stoveburner 4, a stoveburner 3, a stoveburner 2, a stoveburner 1, and a toaster 1.

[Output]
<think>
The required object is lettuce, and the final location is the dining table. The cleaning step is mandatory and must use the unique `sinkbasin 1`. I will persist `sinkbasin 1` as the cleaning site and `diningtable 1` as the goal. I will also build `all_location_IDs` from the initial observation. The decomposition mirrors the previous case: systematically search and take a lettuce, clean it at the sink, then navigate to the dining table and place the item. I must be careful to open any closed storage (e.g., cabinet, drawer, fridge, microwave) before taking and avoid using move to a closed container. Finally, I will ensure the regex extracts the exact lettuce ID from the observation.

cleaning_location_ID = 'sinkbasin 1'
target_location_ID = 'diningtable 1'
obj = 'lettuce'
all_location_IDs = re.findall(r'[a-z]+(?:[a-z]+)? \d+', observation)

obj_ID = find_and_take(obj, all_location_IDs)
clean_with(obj_ID, cleaning_location_ID)
put_in(obj_ID, target_location_ID)

[Input]
The current function to expand is:
obj_ID = find_and_take(obj, all_location_IDs)
The variables you can use is:
- obj (str): apple
- all_location_IDs (list[str]): ['cabinet 4', 'cabinet 3', 'cabinet 2', 'cabinet 1', 'coffeemachine 1', 'countertop 1', 'diningtable 3', 'diningtable 2', 'diningtable 1', 'drawer 1', 'fridge 1', 'garbagecan 1', 'microwave 1', 'sidetable 1', 'sinkbasin 1', 'stoveburner 4', 'stoveburner 3', 'stoveburner 2', 'stoveburner 1', 'toaster 1']

[Output]
<think>
The goal is to navigate the room methodically to find any instance of the target object and pick it up. I will iterate through the known locations, always navigating first. If a location produces no new information, I will examine it. When a location is closed, I will open it before searching. Once I observe a concrete `{obj} k` mention, I will parse that exact ID and take it from the current location. Common pitfalls include not examining after navigation (missing items), failing to open a closed container, or taking without the full `obj_ID`.
</think>

<execute>
for location_ID in all_location_IDs:
    obs = run(f'go to {location_ID}')
    if 'Nothing happens.' in obs:
        obs = run(f'examine {location_ID}')
    location_closed = 'closed' in obs
    if location_closed:
        obs = run(f'open {location_ID}')
    if f" {obj} " in obs: # Prevent names from containing relationships
        obj_ID = re.search(rf'\b{obj} \d+\b', obs).group()
        run(f'take {obj_ID} from {location_ID}')
        break
</execute>




[Input]
The current function to expand is:
clean_with(obj_ID, cleaning_location_ID)
The variables you can use is:
- obj_ID (str): apple 1
- cleaning_location_ID (str): sinkbasin 1

[Output]
<think>
Cleaning must be performed at the sinkbasin only. I will explicitly navigate to the recorded cleaning site and issue the cleaning command with the exact object ID. I do not need to open the sink; I only need to be there. A typical error is to attempt to clean somewhere else or to forget to navigate first.
</think>

<execute>
run(f'go to {cleaning_location_ID}')
run(f'clean {obj_ID} with {cleaning_location_ID}')
</execute>




[Input]
The current function to expand is:
put_in(obj_ID, target_location_ID)
The variables you can use is:
- obj_ID (str): apple 1
- target_location_ID (str): sidetable 1

[Output]
<think>
I will navigate to the target location, examine if nothing happens, determine if it is closed, and open if needed. Then I will move the object in. This logic supports both containers (openable) and surfaces (non-openable, but harmless to check). Pitfalls: using the wrong ID in `examine` or skipping the `location_closed` check.
</think>

<execute>
obs = run(f'go to {target_location_ID}')
if 'Nothing happens.' in obs:
    obs = run(f'examine {target_location_ID}')
location_closed = 'closed' in obs
if location_closed:
    obs = run(f'open {target_location_ID}')
run(f'move {obj_ID} to {target_location_ID}')
</execute>
