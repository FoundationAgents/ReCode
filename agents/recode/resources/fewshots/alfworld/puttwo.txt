[Input]
The current function to expand is:
solve(instruction, observation)
The variables you can use is:
- instruction (str): Your task is to: put two cellphone in sofa.
- observation (str): You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a coffeetable 1, a diningtable 1, a drawer 4, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a dresser 1, a garbagecan 1, a sidetable 2, a sidetable 1, and a sofa 1.

[Output]
<think>
This function must stay high-level — use only the given placeholder helpers, never any primitive `run(...)` calls. Firstly, based on the instruction and observation, we declare the variables we need. Then the expansion should be decomposed into two concrete phases: (1) find and take a cellphone, (2) place the cellphone on the sofa. Because I can carry only one object at a time, I must strictly follow this order: (1) find and take a cellphone, (2) place the cellphone on the sofa. I must **not** search for both items before placing the first. I must **not** reorder, merge, or inline any steps. Violating these rules will produce incorrect behavior.
</think>

<execute>
obj, target_location_ID, all_location_IDs = declare_init_vars(instruction, observation)

obj_ID, location_ID = find_and_take(obj, all_location_IDs)
put_on(obj_ID, target_location_ID) # Must pick one and put one down, as you cannot hold two at the same time

all_location_IDs = update_all_location_IDs(location_ID, target_location_ID, all_location_IDs)

obj_ID = find_and_take_again(obj, all_location_IDs)
put_on_again(obj_ID, target_location_ID)
</execute>

The current function to expand is:
obj, target_location_ID, all_location_IDs = declare_init_vars(instruction, observation)
The variables you can use is:
- instruction (str): Your task is to: put two cellphone in sofa.
- observation (str): You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a coffeemachine 1, a countertop 1, a diningtable 3, a diningtable 2, a diningtable 1, a drawer 1, a fridge 1, a garbagecan 1, a microwave 1, a sidetable 1, a sinkbasin 1, a stoveburner 4, a stoveburner 3, a stoveburner 2, a stoveburner 1, and a toaster 1.
[Output]
<think>
I need to extract four variables: obj, target_location_ID, and all_location_IDs. First, it is observed that obj and target_location_ID can be obtained from the instruction. In the observation, multiple locations are found, so regular expressions are used to extract them. Finally, a specific target_location_ID is declared.
</think>

<execute>
target_location_ID = 'sofa 1'
obj = 'cellphone'
all_location_IDs = re.findall(r'[a-z]+(?:[a-z]+)? \d+', observation)
</execute>




[Input]
The current function to expand is:
obj_ID, location_ID = find_and_take(obj, all_location_IDs)
The variables you can use is:
- obj (str): apple
- all_location_IDs (list[str]): ['cabinet 4', 'cabinet 3', 'cabinet 2', 'cabinet 1', 'coffeemachine 1', 'countertop 1', 'diningtable 3', 'diningtable 2', 'diningtable 1', 'drawer 1', 'fridge 1', 'garbagecan 1', 'microwave 1', 'sidetable 1', 'sinkbasin 1', 'stoveburner 4', 'stoveburner 3', 'stoveburner 2', 'stoveburner 1', 'toaster 1']

<think>
The goal is to navigate the room methodically to find any instance of the target object and pick it up. I will iterate through the known locations, always navigating first. If a location produces no new information, I will examine it. When a location is closed, I will open it before searching. Once I observe a concrete `{obj} k` mention, I will parse that exact ID and take it from the current location. Common pitfalls include not examining after navigation (missing items), failing to open a closed container, or taking without the full `obj_ID`.
</think>

<execute>
for location_ID in all_location_IDs:
    obs = run(f'go to {location_ID}')
    if 'Nothing happens.' in obs:
        obs = run(f'examine {location_ID}')
    location_closed = 'closed' in obs
    if location_closed:
        obs = run(f'open {location_ID}')
    if f" {obj} " in obs: # Prevent names from containing relationships
        obj_ID = re.search(rf'\b{obj} \d+\b', obs).group()
        run(f'take {obj_ID} from {location_ID}')
        break
</execute>




[Input]
The current function to expand is:
put_in(obj_ID, target_location_ID)
The variables you can use is:
- obj_ID (str): apple 1
- target_location_ID (str): sidetable 1

[Output]
<think>
I will navigate to the target location, examine if nothing happens, determine if it is closed, and open if needed. Then I will move the object in. This logic supports both containers (openable) and surfaces (non-openable, but harmless to check). Pitfalls: using the wrong ID in `examine` or skipping the `location_closed` check.
</think>

<execute>
obs = run(f'go to {target_location_ID}')
if 'Nothing happens.' in obs:
    obs = run(f'examine {target_location_ID}')
location_closed = 'closed' in obs
if location_closed:
    obs = run(f'open {target_location_ID}')
run(f'move {obj_ID} to {target_location_ID}')
</execute>




[Input]
The current function to expand is:
all_location_IDs = update_all_location_IDs(location_ID, target_location_ID, all_location_IDs)
The variables you can use is:
- location_ID (str): cabinet 1
- target_location_ID (str): sidetable 1
- all_location_IDs (list[str]): ['cabinet 4', 'cabinet 3', 'cabinet 2', 'cabinet 1', 'coffeemachine 1', 'countertop 1', 'diningtable 3', 'diningtable 2', 'diningtable 1', 'drawer 1', 'fridge 1', 'garbagecan 1', 'microwave 1', 'sidetable 1', 'sinkbasin 1', 'stoveburner 4', 'stoveburner 3', 'stoveburner 2', 'stoveburner 1', 'toaster 1']

[Output]
<think>
I will refresh the candidate list so the next search resumes from the exact container where the last object was found. I must slice starting at `all_location_IDs.index(location_ID)`—**no `+1`**—and I must **never** index by `target_location_ID`. After slicing, I remove `target_location_ID` to avoid re-taking from the destination. Using `target_location_ID` in the index, adding `+1`, or removing the target before slicing are all incorrect.
</think>

<execute>
all_location_IDs = all_location_IDs[all_location_IDs.index(location_ID):]
if target_location_ID in all_location_IDs:
    all_location_IDs.remove(target_location_ID)
</execute>




[Input]
The current function to expand is:
obj_ID = find_and_take_again(obj, all_location_IDs)
The variables you can use is:
- obj (str): apple
- all_location_IDs (list[str]): ['sinkbasin 1', 'stoveburner 4', 'stoveburner 3', 'stoveburner 2', 'stoveburner 1', 'toaster 1']

[Output]
<think>
This is the second cycle after the refresh; I must re-search from the updated `all_location_IDs` and obtain a new exact object ID, not reuse the previous one. I will follow the same safe traversal as before: go, examine if needed, open if closed, parse the precise `{obj} k`, and take it.
</think>

<execute>
for location_ID in all_location_IDs:
    obs = run(f'go to {location_ID}')
    if 'Nothing happens.' in obs:
        obs = run(f'examine {location_ID}')
    location_closed = 'closed' in obs
    if location_closed:
        obs = run(f'open {location_ID}')
    if f" {obj} " in obs: # Prevent names from containing relationships
        obj_ID = re.search(rf'\b{obj} \d+\b', obs).group()
        run(f'take {obj_ID} from {location_ID}')
        break

The current function to expand is:

This is the second placement; I keep the same high-level pattern: go to the target, examine if nothing happens, open only if the target is closeable, then move the object onto it. I do not inline any other primitives here.
</think>

<execute>
obs = run(f'go to {target_location_ID}')
if 'Nothing happens.' in obs:
    obs = run(f'examine {target_location_ID}')
location_closed = 'closed' in obs
if location_closed:
    obs = run(f'open {target_location_ID}')
run(f'move {obj_ID} to {target_location_ID}')
