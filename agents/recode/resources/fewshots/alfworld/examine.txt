[Input]
The current function to expand is:
solve(instruction, observation)
The variables you can use is:
- instruction (str): Your task is to: look at bowl under the desklamp.
- observation (str): You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a bed 1, a desk 1, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a garbagecan 1, a safe 1, a shelf 5, a shelf 4, a shelf 3, a shelf 2, a shelf 1, a sidetable 2, and a sidetable 1.

[Output]
<think>
I can extract all location IDs from the initial observation. I need to look at a bowl under the desklamp. I will (1) parse `all_location_IDs`, (2) find and take a bowl, (3) find the desklamp and use it, and (4) immediately examine the bowl so the “look at” happens under the light. Pitfalls: forgetting to build `all_location_IDs`, not declaring `look_obj`, or skipping the final `examine`.
</think>

<execute>
obj = 'bowl'
look_obj = 'desklamp'
all_location_IDs = re.findall(r'[a-z]+(?:[a-z]+)? \d+', observation)

obj_ID = find_and_take(obj, all_location_IDs)
find_and_use_to_look_at(look_obj, obj_ID)
</execute>

The current function to expand is:
solve(instruction, observation)
The variables you can use is:
- instruction (str): Your task is to: examine the pen with the desklamp.
- observation (str): You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a bed 1, a drawer 10, a drawer 9, a drawer 8, a drawer 7, a drawer 6, a drawer 5, a drawer 4, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a dresser 1, a garbagecan 1, a shelf 9, a shelf 8, a shelf 7, a shelf 6, a shelf 5, a shelf 4, a shelf 3, a shelf 2, and a shelf 1.

[Output]
<think>
I need the same pattern but for a pen. I will build `all_location_IDs`, then find and take a pen, switch on the desklamp, and examine the pen right away. Pitfalls: missing `look_obj` or forgetting to examine after turning on the lamp.
</think>

<execute>
obj = 'pen'
look_obj = 'desklamp'
all_location_IDs = re.findall(r'[a-z]+(?:[a-z]+)? \d+', observation)

obj_ID = find_and_take(obj, all_location_IDs)
find_and_use_to_look_at(look_obj, obj_ID)
</execute>




[Input]
The current function to expand is:
obj_ID = find_and_take(obj, all_location_IDs)
The variables you can use is:
- obj (str): apple
- all_location_IDs (list[str]): ['cabinet 4', 'cabinet 3', 'cabinet 2', 'cabinet 1', 'coffeemachine 1', 'countertop 1', 'diningtable 3', 'diningtable 2', 'diningtable 1', 'drawer 1', 'fridge 1', 'garbagecan 1', 'microwave 1', 'sidetable 1', 'sinkbasin 1', 'stoveburner 4', 'stoveburner 3', 'stoveburner 2', 'stoveburner 1', 'toaster 1']

<think>
The goal is to navigate the room methodically to find any instance of the target object and pick it up. I will iterate through the known locations, always navigating first. If a location produces no new information, I will examine it. When a location is closed, I will open it before searching. Once I observe a concrete `{obj} k` mention, I will parse that exact ID and take it from the current location. Common pitfalls include not examining after navigation (missing items), failing to open a closed container, or taking without the full `obj_ID`.

<execute>
for location_ID in all_location_IDs:
    obs = run(f'go to {location_ID}')
    if 'Nothing happens.' in obs:
        obs = run(f'examine {location_ID}')
    location_closed = 'closed' in obs
    if location_closed:
        obs = run(f'open {location_ID}')
    if f" {obj} " in obs: # Prevent names from containing relationships
        obj_ID = re.search(rf'\b{obj} \d+\b', obs).group()
        run(f'take {obj_ID} from {location_ID}')
        break

The current function to expand is:
find_and_use_to_look_at(look_obj, obj_ID)
The variables you can use is:
- look_obj (str): desklamp
- obj_ID (str): bowl 1

[Output]
<think>
I will search for the desklamp just like any object: navigate, examine if needed, open if closed, and when I see it, extract its ID and use it. Immediately after, I will examine the `obj_ID` so the “look at” happens under the lamp. Pitfalls: forgetting the final `examine {obj_ID}`, or not extracting the full `look_obj_ID`.
</think>

<execute>
for location_ID in all_location_IDs:
    obs = run(f'go to {location_ID}')
    if 'Nothing happens.' in obs:
        obs = run(f'examine {location_ID}')
    location_closed = 'closed' in obs
    if location_closed:
        obs = run(f'open {location_ID}')
    if look_obj in obs:
        look_obj_ID = re.search(rf'\b{look_obj} \d+\b', obs).group()
        run(f'use {look_obj_ID}')
